# Fracture.app

I would love to see something that is functional as my browser homepage, where I can re-arrange my **Universal Profile** without having too many restrictions. 

The **UP Grid** is great, but pretty limited in terms of showcasing and sharing profile links. You cannot truly set it up in the way you want, and having a few key customization options changes the whole game, in my opinion.

I'm not looking for a responsive/mobile-friendly dApp with Fracture; this is purely **desktop-focused (for now)**. I want this **Grid Layout** functioning primarily as some sort of an **editor** with **savable layouts** (settings/parameters saved as `.json`, which makes it possible to save to your metadata, right?). It would function as the perfect **base layer** for future featuresâ€”a **personal sandbox and browser homepage**.

Being able to **place icons (bookmarks)** and save the layout the way you want would be really awesome to have, I think, and would immediately make the dApp overall way more functional. It must be **flexible enough to easily add new components** without breaking everything. 

By any means, I am NOT a dev, but trying to implement the scripts broke it constantly, so I gave up. Also, I think you'd just want to rebuild this, no?

**IF** you find this to be something with potential and you'd like to expand on this and build it together or something, I have a whole lot of pretty good ideas actually.

## Icons / Functionality

- The application would allow you to **import your Universal Profile**, and fetch your `settings.json` for your previously saved layout state. A **1-click connect** was also coming according to Feindura.  
  - This is done with the top icon on the left toolbar. It would allow you to **edit your profile metadata** and place it in the middle of your screen, "lock it" there, and build stuff you want to showcase freely around your UP window.
  - It is not my idea to just load every single NFT inside your UP and display it randomly. Instead, you should **select what you want to showcase** or use for experimentation inside the dApp.

- **Music Player**: Underneath the import icon, you'll find a music player. It could support internet radio, SoundCloud, etc.  
  - Audio will be a huge thing because below the music player icon, thereâ€™s a **Visualizer Window**.  
    - A script responding to audio and feeding off images creates **utility for every single NFT**, which otherwise might feel underutilized.  

  ### Bonus Idea: Patchbay Integration
  - Imagine having an **output (audio jack)** on most of the devices we expand this with. You could click the output jack on one device (e.g., the music player), drag the mouse to create a cable, and patch it into an input of choice.  
    - For example: `Music Player OUT â†’ Visualizer IN`.  
    - Another example: `Audio NFT OUT â†’ Music Player IN â†’ Visualizer IN`.

  - Even more complex setups could look like this:  
    - `NFT OUT â†’ MUSIC IN â†’ EQUALIZER IN â†’ EFFECT IN â†’ VISUALIZER IN`.  
    - Check out **Reason Rack** (Google "Reason Rack" and look at the images). The UI of that software looks like a real 19-inch server rack, and that would be the most awesome thing ever to implement for these attachable effects/interfaces.  

- The **Visualizer Window** could also pick up onboard sound playing on your desktop. This is super useful for live music with analog gear.

- **Transparency Toggle**: Each window would have a "T" button for transparency. Ideally, only the frame/background becomes transparent, and the content remains visible.  
  - Why? If you create assets with a transparent background, the visualization/animation appears to float and morph on top of your grid.

- **Other Icons**:
  - **Inventory Icon**: Load the NFTs you want to use and manage them easily.  
  - **Echo (Animation Script)**: Running animations.  
  - **Patchbay**: Connect components as described above.  
  - **Settings**: Change color schemes, layouts, etc.  
  - **Save Layout**: Save your customized layout and parameters.

## Why This Needs to Be Built
This app could open a lot of possibilities. I donâ€™t know how hard the implementation would be or how much time it would take, but having an MVP ready for LUKSO grants would be fantastic. 

I would **really love your input** on this. If youâ€™re too busy, let me know, and Iâ€™ll look for someone else to help me bring this to life. For me, **everything comes together here**, including the art I make for this purpose.

### Questions:
- Do you think this has potential? 
- What are your thoughts on **Fracture.app**? 

The domain is availableâ€”not the cheapest, but awesome nonetheless.
