# Fracture.app


The **UP Grid** is great, but pretty limited in terms of showcasing and sharing profile links. You cannot truly set it up in the way you want, and having a few key customization options could change the whole game.
That's what I have in mind with this dApp. A grid based sandbox with a flexible and customizable layout where my creations I released and already have released will be raised to the next level.
If someone would raise the question: "How could you give every single, otherwise useless pfp NFT / artwork utility that is inside your UP. I have the answer to it."

I'm not looking for a responsive/mobile-friendly dApp with Fracture; this is purely **desktop-focused (for now)**. I want this **Grid Layout** functioning primarily as some sort of an **editor** with **savable layouts** (settings/parameters saved as `.json`, makes it possible to save to your metadata, right?). It would function as the perfect **base layer** for future features.

Imagine the dApp really feeling like your desktop background. Being able to **place icons (bookmarks) to other dApps** and save the layout the way you want would be really awesome to have, I think, and would immediately make the dApp overall way more used in general because it has the intention to be used this way. It must be **flexible enough to easily add new components** without breaking everything. It would let you rebuild your universal profile in a very customizable way.

By any means, I am NOT a dev, but trying to implement the scripts broke it constantly, so I gave up. Also, I think you'd just want to rebuild this yourself in the end. It's not alot what I have here but I think it's enough for you to understand how it works.

**IF** you find this to be something with potential and you'd like to expand on this and build it together or something, I have a whole lot of pretty good ideas actually to expand this further.
The most important is just that this grid and the placement of the windows and the resizing on this snapable grid in combination with the scripts works perfectly.

## Icons / Functionality

- The application would allow you to **import your Universal Profile**, and fetch your `settings.json` for your previously saved layout state. A **1-click connect** was also coming according to Feindura.
- This would make interacting with this automatically load in your own layout.
  - This is done with the top icon on the left toolbar. Import your UP and allow you to **edit your profile metadata** and place it for example in the middle of your screen, "lock it" there, and build stuff you want to showcase freely around your UP window.
  - It is not my idea to just load every single NFT inside your UP and display it randomly. Instead, you should **select what you want to showcase** or use for experimentation inside the dApp. The thing where this will really shines is the alignment of the windows.
  doing it edge to edge will give you the real creative possibilits to showcase your UP.

- **Music Player**: Underneath the import icon, you'll find a music player It could support internet radio, SoundCloud, etc.  
  - Audio will be a huge thing because below the music player icon, thereâ€™s a **Visualizer Window**.  
    - A script responding to audio and feeding off my assets. If you expand this functionality with a functionality that fetches the other images from NFTs inside your UP it suddenly creates **utility for every NFT**.

- The **Visualizer Window** could also pick up onboard sound playing on your desktop. I play alot of music live, with analog gear. just routing the audio to my soundcard makes this visualizer already work. To live music I'm playing.
- Hook it up to a projector and you have nice visuals coming from the static NFTs inside your UP.

- **Transparency Toggle**: Each window has this "T" button for transparency. Ideally, only the frame/background becomes transparent, and the content remains visible. this is not working correctly in my version
  as it just makes all of it transparant.
  - Why? If you create assets with a transparent background, with the functionality of this already in mind, the visualization/animation appears to float on top of your grid instead of being framed inside this window. This makes / breaks the complete imersion of being cohesive.

- **Other Icons**:
  - **Inventory Icon**: Load the NFTs you want to use and manage them easily.  
  - **Echo (Animation Script)**: Running animations.  
  - **Patchbay**: Connect components as described above.  
  - **Settings**: Change color schemes, layouts, etc.  
  - **Save Layout**: Save your customized layout and parameters.

## Why This Needs to Be Built
This app could open a lot of possibilities. I donâ€™t know how hard the implementation would be or how much time it would take.

I would **really love your input** on this. If youâ€™re too busy, let me know, and Iâ€™ll look for someone else to help me bring this to life. For me, **everything comes together here**, what i made in the past and everything that comes.

### Questions:
- Do you think this has potential? 
- What are your thoughts on **Fracture.app**? 

The domain is available too
